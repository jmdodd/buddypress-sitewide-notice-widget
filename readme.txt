Wrap the BuddyPress sitewide notice in a widget.

== Description ==

The BuddyPress default theme provides users with an area in the sidebar for the 
display and dismissal of sitewide notices. This plugin wraps that code in a 
widget so that users can easily add that functionality to their own widget-ready
sidebar without editing `sidebar.php`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `buddypress-sitewide-notice-widget` and its contents to 
the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Add the BuddyPress Sitewide Notice widget to a widget area in 'Appearance > 
Widgets'.
